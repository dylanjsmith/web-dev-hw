The universal selector is used to style every element on a page. The universal selector is applied by using a star. This would be used if the developer simply wanted to have every element on a page styled the same way. The element selector is used to select all elements of a certain type. This selector is applied by simply using an element name. This would be used if a developer hypothetically wanted to be selective and calculated about which element they want styled. The class selector is applied to class attributes and is denoted with a ".". This would be used by a developer who wants to style certain attributes from classes in a methodical and creative way. The id selector allows developers to define style rules for a specific element by calling its unique ID. This would be used by a developer who wants to apply a very special style set to a very specific part of a page.

I went with a color palette that I feel properly encompasses disco and scooby-doo from the 1970's. I went with violet, orange, and lime. Next time I will be more daring and incorporate RGB values and hex codes.

I am not going to sugarcoat it, I procrastinated and waited until Monday afternoon to start reading the material from the website and watch the walkthrough. I am ashamed of myself, I was unexpectedly busy over the weekend. I completed the assignment late on Monday night on November 4th.
