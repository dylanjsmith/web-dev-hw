There are five main document elements (meta,viewpoint,title,link,style) for the head which tell the browser and processor information about the HTML document like the title, author and the publication date.The head contains the thoughts of the page. There are two different elements for the body which contain structural and semantic markup. The body element is essentially the meat and potatoes of the site.

The difference between structural and semantic markup is that structural markup embeds information about the structure of a document to help guide a user visually and provide information about the type of content through a document. Semantic markup is used to reinforce the semantics of the information in a document. It is used primarily to place emphasis on a word or phrase.

This cycle I was able to build off of what I had learned in previous modules and hone in and develop my craft. I am getting more comfortable using html and being able to anticipate fundamental steps I need to take in order to create an operable page. I digested the content from the website for two days and watched the walkthrough a few times in order to understand what it would take for me to achieve flawless victory on this assignment.
