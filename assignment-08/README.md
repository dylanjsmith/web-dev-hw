The experience of learning HTML was difficult for me to digest. I was
able to grasp the fact that every element I use is like a sandwich that has to
be open and closed with brackets. In particular, I do not have a
great understanding of the meta elements and their function, and I struggled to
comprehend the form input elements as well. I will continue to practice and get better.
I am fascinated by what I am learning and have a desire to learn more advanced concepts.

I am tickled pink to learn how I can bring my projects to life. I am real intrigued
to learn the logistics of color and how to incorporate them better into my projects. I
also am excited to learn how to incorporate borders and other ornamental features.
I am nervous because everything I am learning is being compounded and I worry I will get
confused with hyper-specific details that come later.

I started thinking about what I was going to cover in my assignment starting on Friday October, 17.
I began reviewing the materials and watched the walkthrough early on Sunday morning and got some of the assignment completed that evening. I spent Monday evening working out the kinks and getting it to the point of being quality work. I worked about 5 or 6 hours on this assignment.
