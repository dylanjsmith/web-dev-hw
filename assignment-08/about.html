  <h1>My inspiration for this project</h1>
  <p>I am an aspiring basketball coach, and I have worked with athletes ranging
    from preschool to professional. I hope to become a coach at a high level someday.
    I chose this project because I feel there could
    come a time when someone has to make a free throw to win a steak dinner and they could
    utilize my principles to lead them to victory. Most people don't realize the mental
    aspect that goes into being able to be a good free throw shooter. I just want my audience to
    know that simply relaxing and shooting the same way every single time increases the liklihood of succcess
    on an attempted shot. Shooting hoops is a great way to exercise and be in a competitive environment.
