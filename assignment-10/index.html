      <h1><u>John F. Kennedy Moon Speech</u></h1>
      <h2><u>September 12, 1962</u></h2>

      <div class="text">
        <p>We set sail on this new sea because there is
          new knowledge to be gained, and new rights to be won,
          and they must be won and used for the progress of all people.
          For space science, like nuclear science and all technology,
          has no conscience of its own.
          Whether it will become a force for good or ill depends on man,
          and only if the United States occupies a position of pre-eminence
          can we help decide whether this new ocean will be a sea of peace
          or a new terrifying theater of war.
          I do not say the we should or will go unprotected
          against the hostile misuse of space any more than we go unprotected
          against the hostile use of land or sea,
          but I do say that space can be explored
          and mastered without feeding the fires of war,
          without repeating the mistakes that man
          has made in extending his writ around this globe of ours.</p>

          <p>There is no strife, no prejudice, no national conflict in outer space as yet.
          Its hazards are hostile to us all.
          Its conquest deserves the best of all mankind,
          and its opportunity for peaceful cooperation many never come again.
          But why, some say, the moon?
          Why choose this as our goal?
          And they may well ask why climb the highest mountain?
          Why, 35 years ago, fly the Atlantic? Why does Rice play Texas?</p>

          <p>We choose to go to the moon.
          We choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things,
          not because they are easy, but because they are hard,
          because that goal will serve to organize
          and measure the best of our energies and skills,
          because that challenge is one that we are willing to accept,
          one we are unwilling to postpone, and one which we intend to win,
          and the others, too.</p>

          <p>It is for these reasons that I regard the decision
          last year to shift our efforts in space from low to high gear as
          among the most important decisions that will be made
          during my incumbency in the office of the Presidency.</p>
