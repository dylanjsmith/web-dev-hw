    <h1>About Page</h1>
    <p>Matsuo Basho was one of the greatest Japanese poets to ever live.
      He elevated haiku to the level of serious poetry
      in numerous travel diaries. He was also referred to as “Sengin”,
      which is his penname. It is rumored that
      his father may have been a low-ranking samurai.</p>
